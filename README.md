open-bluetooth-intents
=========

Open Bluetooth Intents links your Android phone with your Arduino (or other MCU) project.  Your application can require users to install a seperate app, thus reducing the amount of code you need to write.  Or, you can embed Bessan in your Android Application as an Android Service.  Currently only Arduino is supported.  PIC support is planned.  Supported BT modules on Arduino:  (should include) all popular SPP-profile-compatible BT modules that work with Arduino&#39;s SoftwareSerialLibrary.
